            <image src="T2.jpg" height="300px" width="500px" align="left" style="margin-left: 75px; margin: top 200px;"> 
                    <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 25px;font-family: Ink free;color:rgb(248, 240, 205) ;text-align: center;">Siberian Tiger</h3><br>
                    <p style="margin-left: 45%;"> The Siberian tiger is generally considered the biggest of the species, though it’s similar in size to the Bengal tiger. Its average size is around 5 – 7 feet long, and some males can reach 10 feet or more. The heaviest on record was a staggering 660 pounds! The Siberian tiger is also known for its broad chest and large skull. Since it lives in cold, snowy regions, including mountain passes, it has thick fur to help it survive harsh winters. It also tends to be a paler orange than its more vibrant cousins.
                                                A fun fact about Siberian tigers is that they’ve been known to take down bears. While they prefer smaller prey like deer and antelope, they’ll go after bears when food is scarce. Sometimes, the bears strike back by killing young and female tigers.

                    <p style="margin-left: 45%;">The Bengal tiger is one of the most well-known tiger breeds. In fact, it’s probably what comes to mind when you picture a tiger. It has orange fur with white tufts around the ears and black stripes down the back, and it boasts strong jaws, powerful hind legs and front paws that can literally decapitate its prey.Additionally, some Bengal tigers are born with a genetic mutation that gives them white fur and blue eyes. They aren’t actually albino; it’s just a quirk of the genes controlling their pigmentation. Both parents need to carry the gene for a cub to be born this way. It’s a rare coupling, so white tigers represent just one in every 10,000 births.
                    As one of the oldest tiger species, Bengal tigers have been around for 12,000 – 16,500 years. They date back to the Late Pleistocene period.

                        <p style="margin-left: 45%;">Like its name suggests, the Indochinese tiger is found around the Indochina region of Asia. Its biggest populations are in Thailand, Burma and Vietnam.It’s sometimes known as Corbett’s tiger, and its scientific name includes corbetti. This is in honor of famous British hunter Jim Corbett. He was often called on to kill man-eating tigers and leopards in the early 20th century.
                                Like all living tiger species, the Indochinese tiger is endangered, and its numbers are dwindling fast. Some experts say that it should be classified as “critically endangered” now. There are only around 300 – 400 left.
                                Illegal trade is the main reason for its decline. Just about every part of the tiger can be used in rituals, medicines, clothes, jewelries and wines, so there’s always a demand for them. Pelts can be traded; claws and bones can be ground into pastes and poultices; internal organs can be eaten.

                        <p style="margin-left: 45%;">The Malayan tiger has many similarities with the Indochinese tiger. In fact, it wasn’t considered a separate breed until the early 2000s. This is why there’s debate about its scientific name: When it came time to give it a unique designation, some people called it malayensis to reflect its geographic location, and others dubbed it jacksoni in honor of big cat conservationist Peter Jackson.Regardless of what you call them, Malayan tigers are in trouble. They’ve gone from endangered to critically endangered in recent years, and their numbers are still on the decline. There are less than 200 mature adults who are capable of breeding.
                                                    Deforestation is one of the biggest reasons for the downfall of the Malayan tiger. Poaching is another. Like the Indochinese tiger, its bones and pelts are used in everything from traditional medicines to cultural rituals, and a tiger kill is considered a great status symbol among hunters. Conservationists are working hard to protect these tigers while there’s still time.

                    <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 25px;font-family: Ink free;color:rgb(248, 240, 205) ;text-align: center;">South China Tiger</h3><br>
                    <p style="margin-left: 45%;">The South China tiger is an extremely rare species. In fact, it might even be functionally extinct. There are only 30 – 40 of them left, and they’re all in zoos. The South China tiger hasn’t been spotted in the wild in decades.
                        So what happened? In the 1970’s, when the Chinese government was clearing large swatches of land for commercial development, they kept running into tiger hordes. They declared them a pest and tried to exterminate them. The number of South China tigers dropped from more than 4,000 to 40.          
                        The good news is that the government has changed its stance and is now trying to protect this critically endangered species. They’re considered a protected class, and zoos in China and South Africa are actively trying to breed them.
                        Another interesting fact about the South China tiger is that it might have a genetic mutation that gives it blue fur. This has never been proven, but eyewitnesses used to swear that they saw blue-white tigers in the mountains of China. If true, it would be an inherited trait much like the white mutations of the Bengal tiger, and an amazing animal to see!

                        <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 25px;font-family: Ink free;color:rgb(248, 240, 205) ;text-align: center;">Sumatran Tiger</h3><br>
                        <p style="margin-left: 45%;">Outside of zoos, Sumatran tigers are only found on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Scientists believe that rising sea levels are what separated them from “mainland” tigers between 6,000 – 12,000 years ago, so while all of their cousins have close genetic ties, Sumatran tigers have evolved differently.They tend to be smaller than other breeds. For example, they have about half of the heft of a Bengal or Siberian tiger. They’re only slightly shorter, but they have lighter builds and weigh significantly less.Another notable thing about Sumatran tigers is that they’re the only surviving species of tiger in Indonesia. They’re critically endangered, but they’re hanging on. This distinguishes them from both the Bali and Javan tigers that lived in the same area but have gone extinct.
                            Their stripes are another distinguishing feature. They have very dark, defined lines, and they stretch over the entire body. They even have stripes on their forelegs, which not all tiger species do.</p><br><br><br>

                    <p style="margin-left: 45%;"> Congregating around the Caspian Sea, these tigers were fierce, powerful creatures with big skulls and even bigger bodies. The largest specimen ever recorded was 11.8 feet long!
                                                        Sadly, the Caspian tiger has been declared extinct. There are none in captivity, and they haven’t been spotted in the wild for decades. While it’s possible that there are still undiscovered groups out there, conservationists aren’t holding out hope.
                                                        When they were alive, Caspian tigers had muted colors. They were actually called “grey tigers” in their first sightings by 19th century explorers. However, surviving pelts show that they had rusty orange fur with lots of brown.
